## 🌟 Overview

**Zenith** is not just another todo app. It is a **high-performance productivity command center** designed with a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic and deep focus features. It combines the utility of Todoist with the immersive design of a gaming interface.

Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Zenith features a fully custom-built calendar system, a Pomodoro-style Focus Mode, and seamless PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities for installation on any device.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Zenith Ultra UI:** A stunning dark/light mode interface with "Northern Lights" animated backgrounds and frosted glass cards.
- **📅 Custom Date Logic:** A built-from-scratch interactive calendar popover with smart date handling (Today, Tomorrow, Next Week).
- **⚡ Focus Mode:** An immersive, distraction-free overlay with a kinetic ring timer to help you flow through tasks.
- **📱 PWA Ready:** Installable as a native app on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows.
- **🔍 Smart Sidebar:** Quick filters, project organization, and instant task searching.
- **⚡ Live Editing:** Inline editing for task text, dates, and priorities without leaving the list view.
